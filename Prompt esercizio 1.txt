I have an Arduino Uno board
with attached: 
* a TMP36 Temperature sensor
* a RGB LED

attached

Write a C program to be loaded into the Arduino board that
 does the following:
* while the temperature read from the sensor is higher than 
  30 degrees celsius, the led is on,
  and the rest of the time the led is off
